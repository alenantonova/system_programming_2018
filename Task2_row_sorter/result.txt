But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
Calls back the lovely April of her prime:
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
Die single, and thine image dies with thee.
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another;
Of his self-love, to stop posterity?
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
So thou through windows of thine age shall see
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
